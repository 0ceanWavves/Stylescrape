# GitHub Repository Setup

Follow these steps to create a GitHub repository and push your code:

## 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right and select "New repository"
3. Enter the repository name: `stylescrape`
4. Add a description: "A comprehensive toolkit for scraping, analyzing, and working with websites locally"
5. Keep the repository Public (or choose Private if you prefer)
6. Do NOT initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license (since we already have those files)
7. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Push Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands to push an existing repository. Execute the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root directory
cd E:\projects\stylescrape

# Configure Git with your username and email
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stylescrape.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## 3. Verify Your Repository

1. After pushing, refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your files and the commit history

## Next Steps

Once your code is on GitHub, you can:

1. Clone it to other computers
2. Share it with others
3. Deploy it to Netlify (see the README.md file for instructions)
